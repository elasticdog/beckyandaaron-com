			<p>Becky and Aaron decided on a destination wedding up in the North Woods of Wisconsin because they both spent many summers growing up vacationing there. The beauty and serenity of the area makes everything else in life stand still. However, the reception will be occurring in the Illinois Quad City Area on the 19th of July where we hope everyone can join us for wine, food, and celebration.</p>

			<p>Our destination wedding ceremony will be held on Friday July 3rd, 2009 at the <a href="http://www.blackbearlodge.com/">Black Bear Lodge</a> resort on scenic Little St. Germain Lake in northern Wisconsin. Our immediate families are invited to come and join us at the Black Bear Lodge during the week of the wedding for boating, games, campfires, and fun! Unfortunately, we cannot invite everyone to our wedding ceremony due to space limitations.</p>

			<p>The rest of our family and friends are invited to celebrate the occasion with us on Sunday July 19th, 2009 for <a href="/reception/">the reception</a> at Lavender Crest Winery in Colona, Illinois.</p>

			<h3 id="dates">Dates</h3>

			<p>We will be staying at Black Bear Lodge from Sunday June 28th, 2009 through Sunday July 5th, 2009. The wedding ceremony will be held at 4:00pm on that Friday, and if you were invited to the ceremony and cannot come for the pre-wedding vacation, hopefully you can make it there for the ceremony!</p>

			<h3 id="location">Location</h3>

			<p>St. Germain, Wisconsin is located in the northern part of the state just off of State Highway 70 in between Minocqua and Eagle River.</p>
